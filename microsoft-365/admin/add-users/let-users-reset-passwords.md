# Let users reset their own passwords

Getting crushed with people asking you to reset their passwords? As the Microsoft 365 admin, you can let people use the [self-service password reset tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=522677) so you don't have to reset passwords for them. Less work for you! 
  
Here are a few things you need to know:
  
- You get self-service password reset for cloud users **free** with any Microsoft 365 business, education, or nonprofit paid plan. It doesn't work with Microsoft 365 trial. 
    
- It uses Azure. You'll automatically get this feature in Azure for **free** when you do these steps. It won't cost you anything to turn on self-service password reset if you don't use other Azure features. 
    
- **If you're using an on-premises Active Directory**, the above two points don't apply. Rather, you can set this up but **it requires a paid subscription to Azure AD Premium**.
